**NOTICE: Please read the files before using them, there may be some settings that will not work with your system configuration or some that you may not want.**

The main goal of this configuration is to achieve stability by balancing between latency and throughput using 5ms-50ms-500ms sequence of milliseconds

5ms = balanced low latency millisecond

50ms = balanced mid latency millisecond

500ms = balanced high latency millisecond

some things need to be low latency and other things can get away with a higher ms value (increaseing total system throughput).
