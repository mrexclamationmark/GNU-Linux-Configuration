**Info:**

CFS tweaks, network tweaks and memory tweaks are tuned for low latency in a balanced way (less overhead on the low latency spectrum).

Security tweaks are mitigated at the cost some performance (security first, performance after).

**Tips:**

If you have a small amount of CPU cores (1, 2, 4 cores), do not use mesa_glthread or threadirqs
